      <h1>What You Can Do</h1>

      <p>
        Change in the literary world may seem like it belongs to judges and prize committees, but it actually starts in everyday places such as classrooms, libraries, social media, and personal bookshelves. Even small choices can shift which writers are visible and which ones fade quietly into the background.
      </p>

      <p>
        One step is to read women authors intentionally. Look for books written by women, especially women of color, queer women, immigrant women, and women from literary traditions that are not the most promoted. Let curiosity lead you beyond the most advertised names.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another step is to recommend their work. Tell someone about a woman author you enjoyed. Suggestions matter because word of mouth can reach readers who never follow award lists or literary news. Sharing a book you love can help move it into someone else’s permanent memory.

        It also helps to question lists and announcements. When you see a prize winner or a “best books of the year” list, pause and look closely at whose names are included and whose are missing. Instead of accepting the list as complete, ask yourself what types of stories or authors may have been left out.

        Finally, it is important to take different genres seriously when women write them. Shirley Jackson’s experience shows how calling something horror or suspense can be used to push it away from the category of serious literature. The same thing can still happen today with romance, fantasy, young adult fiction, and many other genres that women often shape.

      <p>
        None of these actions will transform the award system overnight, but they matter over time. The books we choose to read, recommend, and refuse to forget can push against old habits and create more space for women to be seen as central in literature. Reading women authors is not only enjoyable. It is part of expanding the space where women are taken seriously as creators, thinkers, and storytellers.
