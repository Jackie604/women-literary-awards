        When I first started thinking about this project, I really just wanted to mix the things I naturally like, such as books, patterns, data, and honestly the way stories shape how we see the world. I always assumed that major book awards like the Booker Prize, the Pulitzer, and the National Book Award were basically fair. If something wins, it must be the best, right?
      </p>

      <p>
        But once I paused and actually asked who gets to win these awards most often, especially when it comes to gender, that idea started to feel shaky. I realized I had taken for granted that greatness in literature was automatically recognized and that judges would simply find it. The more I looked, the more it seemed like patterns were hiding underneath that polite surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        These prizes do more than hand out trophies. They decide which authors become household names, which novels are taught in schools, and which writers get preserved in history as important. So if women are winning far less often, what does that mean for whose voices are remembered or taken seriously? That question stayed with me and became the starting point for this whole project.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site became a place where I could put everything together, such as the numbers showing who actually wins these awards, the stories of women who wrote incredible books but were not fully appreciated at first, and the reflections I had while noticing how all of this fits together. I am not saying that judges dislike women or that no women ever get recognized, but when similar imbalances repeat over decades, it starts to feel like something bigger is happening. My hope is that by exploring this, we can slow down and think about how gender still shapes who is celebrated and who quietly gets pushed to the side, even in spaces that claim to honor the best.
