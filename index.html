        Women in Literature: Representation in Major Awards

      <h1>Women, Awards, and Who Gets Seen</h1>
      <p>
        For this honors project, I wanted to look closely at something that seems simple on the surface but actually says a lot about power. Literary awards like the Booker Prize, the National Book Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction are treated as signs of greatness in literature. When I started asking who actually wins these awards, especially when it comes to gender, I realized the answer is not very balanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is my way of combining research, data, and literary analysis into one project. I share some basic data about how often women have won major English language literary awards, and I connect that information to the lives and legacies of two important women writers, Mary Shelley and Shirley Jackson. Both of them wrote powerful, influential stories, but their recognition did not always match their impact, especially during their lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        By putting the numbers next to their stories, I wanted to better understand how gender shapes who gets rewarded, who gets remembered, and who gets pushed to the side. My goal is not just to present statistics, but to show how data connects to real authors and real patterns of visibility in literature.
      </p>

    <!-- Awards & Data -->
    <section id="data" class="section">
      <h2>Awards and Data</h2>
      <p>
        When I looked at the Booker Prize facts and figures page, I saw that since 1969 there have been thirty six men and eighteen women who have won the award. That means men have won about twice as often as women, even though women have been publishing major novels that entire time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Stacker article based on National Book Foundation data shows that only around twenty women have ever won the National Book Award for Fiction out of about eighty winners total. That means only about one in four fiction winners has been a woman. For the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the Saratoga Springs Public Library notes that just thirty three women have won that prize since it was first awarded in 1918. When I line these numbers up next to each other, I see a pattern. Women are present, but they are still a minority among the most honored names in literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Researchers have noticed this pattern as well. Nicole Giesen’s bachelor’s thesis on gender bias in literary prizes looks specifically at the Booker, Pulitzer, and National Book Awards between 2000 and 2018 and finds that women and their work are still not recognized at equal rates. Other data, like the VIDA Count, shows that women are also underrepresented in the reviews and literary magazines that help build an author’s reputation. All of this makes me feel like the award imbalance is not just random. It connects to how the literary world decides whose stories are serious, whose voices are important, and whose work gets repeated on best of all time lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also learned about writer Nicola Griffith’s data on prize winning books. She found that books about women tend to win awards less often, even when they are written by women. That detail is important to me, because it suggests that it is not only who the author is, but also whose lives and perspectives the story centers. When I think about that, it makes me wonder how many stories about women never get the same level of praise, even if they are just as complex and powerful as books about men.

    <!-- Mary Shelley -->
    <section id="mary" class="section">
      <h2>Mary Shelley Spotlight</h2>
      <p>
        Mary Shelley is often introduced as the author of Frankenstein, but when I started reading about her, I realized she was much more than one famous title. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica and other biographies, she first published Frankenstein in 1818, and at the time it came out anonymously. Many readers assumed a man had written it. The novel later became one of the most famous stories in the world, influencing science fiction, horror, and even philosophy, but Mary Shelley herself did not receive the kind of institutional recognition that later, mostly male, authors would.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I found interesting is how her reputation changed over time. Today, articles from places like ArtsEmerson and the Poetry Foundation describe her as the creator of history’s most famous monster and highlight how original and daring her work was. It feels like the world had to catch up to what she had already done. For a long time, she was overshadowed by her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, or treated as a background figure in literary history, even though her work clearly shaped whole genres.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I place Mary Shelley next to the award data, I see a bigger picture. The numbers show that women are less likely to win major prizes, and Mary’s story shows how even a woman who wrote a groundbreaking, endlessly adapted novel could be treated as secondary for decades. To me, that connection matters because it shows that under recognition is not just about who wins one prize in one year. It is about how women’s contributions get minimized or delayed across generations.
      </p>

    <!-- Shirley Jackson -->
    <section id="shirley" class="section">
      <h2>Shirley Jackson Spotlight</h2>
      <p>
        Shirley Jackson’s story feels a little different but connects to the same theme. In biographies and essays from Biography dot com, the New York Public Library, and critics like Ruth Franklin, she is now described as a major American writer, especially in horror and psychological fiction. Her stories like The Lottery, The Haunting of Hill House, and We Have Always Lived in the Castle are widely taught, adapted, and discussed. But during much of her lifetime, Jackson was not always treated as a serious author in the way some of her male contemporaries were.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruth Franklin, who wrote a full biography of Jackson, has called her a rather haunted and misunderstood figure whose work took time to be recognized as literature, not just entertainment. Today, there is even a Shirley Jackson Award that honors outstanding work in horror, psychological suspense, and dark fantasy. I think it is powerful that an author who did not fully receive her flowers while she was alive now has an award named after her, but it also makes me think about how many women writers never reach that point at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at Jackson through the lens of literary awards makes me notice how recognition can be delayed or uneven. Her writing clearly had quality, depth, and impact, yet the more official signs of literary greatness came much later. When I connect that to the broader statistics on prizes and to the VIDA Count on who gets reviewed and discussed, it becomes easier to see how gender plays a role in who gets to be called a classic in the first place.

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        When I first thought about this project, I just wanted to mix tech and literature in a way that felt meaningful to me. As I started collecting data and reading about Mary Shelley and Shirley Jackson, I realized I was really asking a bigger question. Who gets to be called a great writer, and who decides that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The award numbers already show an imbalance, but pairing them with real women authors makes it feel more personal. Mary Shelley created one of the most influential novels ever written, and Shirley Jackson wrote stories that still shape horror and psychological fiction today. Yet both of them had complicated relationships with recognition and respect. At the same time, the research on gender bias in prizes and publishing shows that these are not just isolated examples. They connect to larger patterns where women’s voices, and especially stories centered on women’s experiences, are not treated as the default or the most serious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building this project helped me think more critically about neutral things like award lists, canons, and best of rankings. Now, when I see a prize announcement, I find myself wondering who is missing from that list and what kinds of stories are being left out. As someone who is studying computer science and cares about representation in tech and media, this project reminded me that data is never just numbers on a chart. It always reflects real people, real opportunities, and real inequalities.
