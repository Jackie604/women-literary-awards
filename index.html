  <h1>Women, Awards, and Who Gets Seen</h1>

  <p>
    For this honors project, I wanted to look closely at something that seems simple on the surface but actually says a lot about power. Literary awards like the Booker Prize, the National Book Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction are treated as neutral signs of greatness. When a book wins one of these, it suddenly becomes more visible, more respected, and more likely to be taught or remembered. At first I assumed these prizes just followed the best writing. But when I started asking who actually wins these awards, especially when it comes to gender, I began to notice that the pattern is not very balanced.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main question became, if these awards shape which authors and books get remembered, what does it mean if women do not win as often. To explore that, I decided to look at data on three major English language prizes, the Booker Prize, the National Book Award for Fiction, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. I wanted to see how often women have been recognized over time and what that might say about who is seen as a serious writer. I also did not want this to stay only at the numbers level, so I chose two women authors whose lives and reputations connect to these issues, Mary Shelley and Shirley Jackson.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mary Shelley and Shirley Jackson are both writers whose work has had a huge impact on literature and popular culture, but for a long time they did not receive the same type of institutional respect that many male authors did. Their stories are now considered classics, yet their recognition was slower and sometimes limited by gendered expectations. By putting the statistics about women and awards next to the stories of these two authors, I wanted to better understand how literary value is decided, who gets rewarded, and who ends up on the edges of the canon.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is my way of combining research, data, and literary analysis into one project. It is not meant to cover every prize or every woman author, but it offers a starting point. My hope is that after looking through the charts and author sections, it becomes easier to see that awards are not just about personal talent. They are also about systems, visibility, and patterns that can either support women writers or leave them waiting for recognition that comes much later, if it comes at all.
  </p>

    <!-- Awards & Data -->
<section id="data" class="section">
  <h2>Awards and Data</h2>

  <p>
    When I started looking at numbers, I wanted to use sources that actually come from the prize organizations or from libraries and research based work. For the Booker Prize, I went to their own facts and figures page. According to the Booker Prizes, since 1969 there have been thirty six men and eighteen women who have won the award (The Booker Prizes, “Booker Prize Facts and Figures”). That ratio means that for every woman winner, there are about two men. Seeing it written out like that, and knowing this is not just one or two years but the entire history of the prize, made the imbalance feel very real.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the National Book Award for Fiction, I used a Stacker article that is based on data from the National Book Foundation. The article points out that only about twenty women have ever won the National Book Award for Fiction out of roughly eighty winners total (Stacker News Staff). In other words, only about one in four fiction winners has been a woman. When I think about it that way, it becomes harder to say this is just an accident. The pattern keeps repeating across different prizes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also looked at a library guide from the Saratoga Springs Public Library that lists women who have won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The guide notes that thirty three women have received this prize since it started in 1918 (Saratoga Springs Public Library). That might sound like a decent number at first, but when I remember that this prize has been around for more than one hundred years, it starts to feel less impressive. Over a full century, women are still not close to being half of the winners.
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand the bigger context, I read a bachelor’s thesis by Nicole Giesen that focuses on gender bias in three major prizes, the Booker, the Pulitzer, and the National Book Awards, between 2000 and 2018. Giesen found that even in the twenty first century, women and their work were still underrepresented among the winners and nominees, which means the problem is not just in the distant past (Giesen). On top of that, organizations like VIDA have counted how often women are reviewed or published in top literary magazines. Reports summarized by Jim Milliot and Porter Anderson show that women are still fighting for equal space in reviews and magazine coverage (Milliot; Anderson). This matters because reviews and media attention help build the reputation that often leads to prizes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also learned about writer Nicola Griffith’s analysis of prize winning novels and the kinds of characters they focus on. Her data suggests that books about women, even when they are written by women, tend to win fewer major awards compared to books that center male characters (Griffith). When I put that idea next to the numbers from the Booker, National Book Award, and Pulitzer, it makes me think that the issue is not only about who is writing, but about whose stories are treated as serious or universal. If books about women are seen as more narrow or less important, that can quietly affect how judges read them, even if nobody openly says it.
  </p>

  <p>
    All together, the data from these different sources pointed me toward the same conclusion. Women do win prizes, and there are important female authors on the lists, but they are still consistently outnumbered and sometimes recognized later than they should be. The imbalance is not just a one time glitch. It is part of a wider pattern in publishing and criticism that shapes which books get a spotlight and which ones quietly fall into the background.

    <!-- Mary Shelley -->
<section id="mary" class="section">
  <h2>Mary Shelley Spotlight</h2>

  <p>
    Mary Shelley is usually introduced as the author of Frankenstein, but when I started reading more about her, I realized that her story also connects to questions of recognition and gender. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, Shelley published Frankenstein in 1818 when she was only in her late teens, and the book originally appeared without her name on the title page (Encyclopaedia Britannica). Many early readers assumed a man had written it. Later, when her name did appear, she was often treated more as Percy Bysshe Shelley’s wife than as a major author in her own right (Biography.com Editors, “Mary Shelley”).
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, places like the Poetry Foundation and ArtsEmerson describe Mary Shelley as the creator of one of the most famous monsters in history and as a key figure in the development of science fiction and Gothic literature (Poetry Foundation; ArtsEmerson). When I think about that shift, it feels like the world took a long time to catch up to what she had already done. Her novel raised questions about science, responsibility, and what it means to be human, ideas that still show up in modern books and films. Yet for decades, she did not get the same type of official or scholarly attention that many male authors received.
  </p>

  <p>
    To me, Mary Shelley’s story mirrors some of the patterns I saw in the award data. Here is a woman who wrote a groundbreaking, constantly adapted novel that shaped entire genres, but her status as a great writer was not fully recognized right away. Instead of being treated as a central, obviously important figure, she had to be rediscovered and reevaluated by later critics and readers. When I place her next to the numbers showing how often women are left out of major prize lists, it starts to feel less like a coincidence and more like a long term habit of underestimating women’s contributions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thinking about Mary Shelley in this context makes me realize that awards and canons reflect not just quality, but also who is taken seriously at the time. If an author like Mary Shelley can be sidelined for years despite creating Frankenstein, then it is not surprising that many other women, especially those with less visible platforms, might never get the recognition they deserve. Her story becomes an early example of how women can be essential to literary history while still being treated as secondary.
  </p>

    <!-- Shirley Jackson -->
<section id="shirley" class="section">
  <h2>Shirley Jackson Spotlight</h2>

  <p>
    Shirley Jackson’s career also shows how recognition can be delayed or uneven for women writers. Biographical sources describe her as a major American author of horror and psychological fiction whose stories explore fear, social pressure, and family life in disturbing ways (Biography.com Editors, “Shirley Jackson”). Her short story “The Lottery” shocked readers when it appeared in The New Yorker in 1948, and her novels The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle are now considered classics of the genre (New York Public Library). Even so, Jackson was not always treated as a serious literary figure during her lifetime.
  </p>

  <p>
    Literary critic Ruth Franklin, who wrote a full length biography of Jackson, argues that Jackson was a misunderstood and often underestimated author whose work was dismissed as mere genre fiction instead of being recognized as complex literature (Franklin). The Free Library of Philadelphia’s catalog for Franklin’s book describes Jackson as a towering figure who did not receive the level of respect she deserved while she was alive (Free Library of Philadelphia). Reading about this made me think about how labels like horror or suspense can sometimes be used to separate women writers from the more “official” category of serious literature.
  </p>

  <p>
    One detail that stood out to me is that there is now a Shirley Jackson Award that honors outstanding work in psychological suspense, horror, and dark fantasy. In a way, this is a beautiful sign of how her reputation has grown over time. At the same time, it also highlights how long it can take for a woman writer’s importance to be fully recognized. Jackson’s work had a deep impact on the genre, but the formal structures of recognition, like major awards and academic attention, did not always keep up with what she was actually doing on the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I connect Jackson’s story back to the award data and the VIDA Count, I see a similar pattern as with Mary Shelley. Women are present, and sometimes they are even central to a genre or movement, but their reputations often have to be fought for or rebuilt later. It makes me wonder how many authors are quietly doing powerful work right now, especially women and other marginalized writers, who will not be fully appreciated until decades after their deaths, if at all.
  </p>

    <!-- Reflection -->
<section id="reflection" class="section">
  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    When I first chose this project, I mostly just wanted to combine literature with data and web design in a way that felt interesting. As I went deeper into the research, I realized that I was actually asking a much bigger question. Who gets to be called a great writer, and who decides that. On paper, prizes and best of lists look neutral, like they simply reflect the highest quality work. But once I started looking at the numbers and pairing them with real authors’ lives, it became harder to believe that talent alone is what shapes literary recognition.
  </p>

  <p>
    The award data showed me a clear pattern. Women do win major prizes, and there are important women on every list, but they are still consistently outnumbered by men. At the same time, many of the stories that are treated as universal or serious focus mainly on male characters and male experiences (Griffith). When I added Mary Shelley and Shirley Jackson into this picture, it gave the numbers a human side. Here are two writers whose work changed literature in huge ways, yet their recognition was slow, partial, or shaped by assumptions about genre and gender. That combination made the idea of a neutral award system feel less convincing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Working on this project also changed how I think about data in general. As a computer science student, I am used to seeing charts, counts, and percentages. But this experience reminded me that every number on a graph is connected to real people, real careers, and real missed opportunities. When I see that only a fraction of major prize winners are women, I am not just looking at statistics. I am also looking at how many voices did not get the same boost in visibility or the same chance to become part of the official literary canon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, this project helped me practice reading like a researcher, not just a fan. Now, when I see a prize announcement or a list of the best books of the year, I catch myself pausing and asking who is missing from the list and whose stories are still being treated as extra instead of essential. My hope is that readers of this site feel something similar. Even if we cannot fix award systems overnight, we can change how we read, who we seek out, and which authors we recommend to others. In that sense, paying attention to gender and recognition in literature is not just an academic exercise. It is a way of making the reading world a little more aware and a little more fair.
