      <h1>Where the Numbers Took Me</h1>

      <p>
        Once I started collecting statistics, I honestly expected them to look uneven but not too alarming. At first, I thought these prizes had probably become more balanced over time and that women were getting closer to equal recognition. I also chose to use sources that come directly from prize organizations or reliable reporting, because I wanted the data to feel grounded and not just based on assumptions. On this page, I turned some of that information into simple bar graphs so it is easier to see the gaps instead of only reading the numbers.

        Looking at the Booker Prize felt like a wake up moment. According to its own facts and figures, since 1969 there have been thirty six male winners and only eighteen female winners (The Booker Prizes, “Booker Prize Facts and Figures”). That means women have won about one out of every three awards. Seeing that imbalance stretch across more than fifty years made it difficult to dismiss as coincidence. In the first graph, I show this as two bars side by side so the difference in wins between men and women is visible at a glance.

        The National Book Award for Fiction was similar but even more dramatic. Based on National Book Foundation records, a Stacker article notes that only around twenty women have ever won this award out of roughly eighty total winners (Stacker News Staff). This means that about three out of every four winners have been men. When an award has existed for decades and still looks this unbalanced, it starts to feel less like randomness and more like a pattern that has been quietly accepted. In the second graph, I tried to reflect that by making the bar for men roughly three times the height of the bar for women.

        The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, one of the most respected literary prizes in the United States, showed its own version of the same story. A Saratoga Springs Public Library guide lists thirty three women winners since the prize was first awarded in 1918 (Saratoga Springs Public Library). That may sound encouraging at first, but it represents more than one hundred years of decision making, and women are still far from half. In the third graph, I decided to focus only on the number of women winners to highlight how small that total still looks when we remember it covers more than a century.

        To see if things had improved more recently, I turned to a bachelor’s thesis by Nicole Giesen that analyzed gender at the Booker, the Pulitzer, and the National Book Award between 2000 and 2018. Her findings show that even in the twenty first century, women remained underrepresented among nominees and winners (Giesen). Reports on the VIDA Count, summarized by Jim Milliot and Porter Anderson, reveal a similar struggle in literary publishing and reviews, where women often receive less space and visibility (Milliot and Anderson). These spaces help build reputations long before awards are announced, so imbalances there can echo into later prize decisions.

        Seeing these numbers together made it difficult to believe that they only reflect who wrote the best books. Women do win, and some women become widely known, but they are still consistently outnumbered, overshadowed, or celebrated later than they should be. The imbalance turns into a quiet habit that repeats itself across time, especially when nobody stops to really look at what the graphs are showing.
