      <h1>Why It Matters More Than It Seems</h1>

      <p>
        At first, I imagined this project as a creative combination of literature, data, and web design. I did not expect it to make me question how voices become visible or invisible in the world of writing. Once I started connecting numbers to people, the project felt heavier than statistics. I was looking at how entire writing careers can be amplified, delayed, or brushed aside depending on who institutions believe is worth remembering.

        The data showed predictable but still surprising patterns. Women do appear on prize lists and many have shaped literature in unforgettable ways, yet they are still consistently outnumbered. Organizations such as VIDA have even created counts to monitor how often women are reviewed or published because fairness in those areas has not happened naturally over time (Anderson and Milliot). Thinking about Mary Shelley and Shirley Jackson alongside this data made the issue feel personal. These are not only numbers. They reflect someone’s life, creativity, and the legacy that either gets built or quietly limited.

        As a computer science student, I am used to reading charts and percentages without attaching emotion to them. This project challenged me to see the people behind the statistics. Every bar on a graph represents a woman who wrote, who submitted, who waited, and who may have never received the same level of attention or platform. If women continue to win fewer awards, it also means fewer of their books are pushed into classrooms, recommended lists, and adaptations. That realization made me more careful about treating award lists as neutral reflections of quality.

        I do not believe that one website can change literary culture or erase bias. I also do not think that every award decision is intentionally unfair. What I do believe is that readers, students, and teachers hold more power than they realize. We choose who we read, who we recommend, which authors we uplift, and which names we remember. Noticing gender patterns does not make literature negative. It simply opens our eyes to who is missing. That awareness is a small but meaningful step toward a literary world where women do not have to prove their seriousness again and again.
