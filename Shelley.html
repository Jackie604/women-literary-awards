      <h1>Mary Shelley</h1>

      <p>
        Mary Shelley is often recognized as the person who wrote <em>Frankenstein</em>, but the more I learned about her, the more it became clear that her legacy runs deeper than just a famous title. She grew up surrounded by writers and ideas, and she published <em>Frankenstein</em> in 1818 while she was still in her late teens (Encyclopaedia Britannica). What surprised me is that the first edition of <em>Frankenstein</em> did not even include her name, and many early readers assumed a man had written it (Encyclopaedia Britannica).

      <p>
        What makes this even more significant is how influential her work became. <em>Frankenstein</em> is not just a classic novel people mention in passing. It is one of the most adapted stories in literary history. There have been films since the early 1900s, stage productions, retellings, cartoons, college courses, graphic novels, and modern reinterpretations. New versions are still being made today, which shows how deeply her imagination entered global culture. Places like the Poetry Foundation and ArtsEmerson now describe her as a foundational voice in science fiction and Gothic literature (Poetry Foundation; ArtsEmerson).

        Even with this level of impact, her recognition during her lifetime was limited. Biographical sources explain that after her name became attached to the novel, she was often described mainly as the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley rather than as a major thinker on her own (Biography.com Editors, “Mary Shelley”). Her work raised questions about humanity, responsibility, and technology long before those conversations were common, but it took decades for institutions to fully acknowledge what she accomplished.

        In this project, Mary Shelley represents more than just a well known author. She embodies the larger pattern I saw in the award data. A woman can write something that changes entire genres and still be overlooked, misread, or pushed into the background. If someone with her influence had to wait for true recognition, it makes me wonder how many women never get rediscovered at all. Her story is a reminder that literary value can exist long before institutions are ready to recognize it.
